    <h1>You Will Win The Future</h1>
    <p>THE CITY SHOOK and cracks ripped through the street. A jagged hole broke open across his path and Shane ran to the sidewalk as the cornice from an old building fell directly ahead of him. Portland was in ruins. He felt the power to create in this disaster. A city reduced to construction and finance. A city made by software. All humanity could be joined to remake their world. Shane thought this city was more than a collection of structures, it was a form of intelligence. On screen his character ran back into the street and text popped up: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? Two buttons: LOOT or HELP.<br><br>
“Cool,” Bradley said.<br><br>
Shane glanced at his boss.<br><br>
“So what are you going to do?” Bradley tucked his chin.<br><br>
Shane looked back to the screen. “Help.”<br><br>
He clicked and three characters appeared: Police, Builder, and Investor. The city was a creation of thought. It was a creation of the world. Bounded by laws, natural and civil, but created. People thinking of their city. An idea built of steel and concrete, copper and glass, plant and animal seated at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia, upon a seat of commerce, a coin spinning in the air. This was the ultimate game. He quickly selected Builder. He was then back in the street of a demolished city, wandering through the rubble. Shane saw a brick glowing with a heartbeat red pulse. The moment his character touched the brick a pleasant chime sounded and a tiny brick appeared in his cache along the bottom of the screen. Did this game have a score? He wondered if it could be won by someone, a team maybe.<br><br>
“Congratulations,” Bradley said. “You just made one hundredth of a cent.”<br><br>
It was Shane’s first day at work. The woman seated next to him had introduced herself when he arrived at nine. Tall and strong, she wore overalls with one strap unbuckled. Her blue hair cut asymmetrically.<br><br>
“You’ll be working with me,” she said. “I’m Rebecca.”<br><br>
Her presence seemed like gravity for the guys. When the producer called everyone to the center of the room and fourteen people stood in a circle facing each other, she was the only woman in the room. Shane caught himself turning to see her reaction as Aydin announced that investors would be in to check out the place on Friday. He recognized Aydin: the co-founder and systems architect. His Egyptian ethnicity further distinguished him from the group. Everyone else was white except for one Indian guy. No one said where the other founder was, and yet Sebastian was the person most gamers associated with the company. He had become the face of Makner.<br><br>
<br><br><br>
Bradley stood beside Shane and showed him how to open an account on Cityzen. It was more than an email and password. The requirements were identical to opening a bank account, and it promised security. Bradley joked, “You ever play a game that beats the stock market?”<br><br>
Shane had no money invested anywhere.<br><br>
He didn’t know anything about the stock market. He smiled; it wasn’t forced. He sat at his new computer. From his work station he could see Rebecca, their desks perpendicular to each other. The light from the screen illuminated her face as she coded floating beam animation. Bradley had his desk directly opposite Shane. Their team leader. Bradley clapped his hand on Shane’s shoulder.<br><br>
“You made the team.”<br><br>
<br><br><br>
The work he’d done making casual games had cinched it. Shane launched a startup with his best friend when they were fifteen and seventeen. Jason was two years older. His parents had immigrated from Taiwan. After releasing games for a decade, Shane thought, by now, Playland would be enough to live on. Shane and his girlfriend stretched to pay the key deposit and first and last month’s rent for a two bedroom in the southeast. He told her that searching by neighborhood was the only way to find what they wanted. You had to know what you wanted and then you could get it, you could really talk it up because you believed. That was your future. It was an optimistic way to deal with the uncertainty of the hiring process—and Elsie believed him.<br><br>
He’d started chatting with her when he got coffee each morning. Her dark bangs above the black frame of her glasses. Elsie was kind to him and she’d pick up where they’d left off the next day. Of course, she did that for all her customers, but she downloaded his games. She played video games, and so he invited her to try a two-player console game at his place and bam, they weren’t even drinking when they fell into each other on the couch.<br><br>
<br><br><br>
Elsie had studied apparel design in college and made her own clothes. Shane’s parents often said she was a wonderful person. They knew she was struggling financially and they had the money to help her, but they weren’t going to give it to someone who wasn’t married to their son. Shane had been with her more than four years and never talked about marriage.<br><br>
It was weird. At first she kept getting pneumonia and she would sleep for twenty hours a day—or else she couldn’t even move to get out of bed. She was amazing and he loved Elsie, but she got sick, really sick. Life had become stressful, but it was worse for his girlfriend. She had to quit her job. Her parents covered her student loans, but weren’t in a position to pay more. The doctors in network weren’t much help either. The antibiotics didn’t improve her condition and a doctor told her it was depression and encouraged her to try getting out of bed. The doctor said she needed to see a psychiatrist. He made her feel like she was making everything up in her mind, like she just wanted attention.<br><br>
And she thought she was going to die. Her headaches could last for days. She couldn’t eat. She could be down for weeks, and then fine—her illness was not consistent.<br><br>
<br><br><br>
“You see that,” Bradley said, watching Shane’s character walk across the screen. The game was in alpha-testing and only employees had access. It would be a massively multi-player online sandbox game. Bricks, wood, glass, steel, and concrete were units of account. People could build anything in the ruined city, and when a player invested their money the structure became permanent. The money was held in an index fund that tracked the five hundred top stocks, regularly beating the managed funds by saving on fees—and staying ahead of inflation.<br><br>
“What?”<br><br>
“That animation.” Bradley followed the character with his finger. “Make it look good by Friday at four.”<br><br>
Rebecca looked over at him.<br><br>
Shane noticed and their eyes met briefly before she leaned into her screen.<br><br>
“Sebastian is going to be in to show the investors and so you need to make that animation look production ready.” Bradley stepped away and rounded the corner as he went to his desk, turning to look at Shane. “The way the character moves over the debris. Every step is the exact same. There’s no collision detection, no shadowing. You good?”<br><br>
“Yeah, I got this!”<br><br>
Bradley had his instructions too, from Aydin.<br><br>
Give him access, give him his task, and leave him be.<br><br>
When Shane opened the codebase, he realized the interview wasn’t over.</p>

    <p id="description">Shane is the new hire at a software company making tools to concentrate wealth and the company’s embrace of militarized hoarding freaks him out. He wants to invest in making civilization work for all and starts a company with the mission to help people self-organize and be universally employed and effective. They build a massive job-matching platform for online labor where incentives and penalties align to create value and distribute it fairly. But their platform must withstand the competition—and it's ruthless. Pundits are trying to discredit Shane as he fights to create the world's biggest platform.
