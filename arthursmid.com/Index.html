  <p>We interpret reality through stories received from our family, our community, our nation. Your understanding of the world changes when you have new experiences and better information.</p>

  <h2>Beliefs inform our behavior.</h2>
  <p>At all times, everywhere I go, a story about life informs my decisions. Ultimately, our stories are about relationships, the rules and expectations of a social being. Your idea of your relationship to the world determines how you act within it.</p>

  <h2>What do you believe in when you believe in yourself?</h2>
  <p>The family, the tribe, the community have all contributed to your beliefs. What is the source of confidence? What is the nature of insecurity? When you face the end of yourself, you can find answers to your questions. It can be an elaborate story, even science needs a story to be understood.</p>
