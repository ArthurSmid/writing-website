  <h2>What's your story?</h2>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <p>We interpret reality through stories received from our family, our community, our nation. Your understanding of the world changes when you have new experiences and better information.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>A story is between reality and what you believe.</h2>
  <p>Reality is reduced to a story so it can be understood, even if only primitively. There are limits to stories: the perspective of the narrator, the method of delivery, what can be understood by the listener. We have only a story. But the story is important—it informs our behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Beliefs inform our behavior.</h2>
  <p>At all times, everywhere I go, a story about life informs my decisions. Ultimately, our stories are about relationships, the rules and expectations of a social being. Your idea of your relationship to the world determines how you act within it.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Values are conscious and unconscious beliefs about life.</h2>
  <p>Your job, your community, your nation: all inform your values. It’s not easy to find a value that everyone shares. People have different values depending on how they source their power.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Where do you get your power?</h2>
  <p>To ensure survival, people adapt to their surroundings. How one chooses to survive in society is an expression of their values. Conditions that empower an individual will influence their values—it could happen within their community, school, profession, or even a relationship.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>What do you believe in when you believe in yourself?</h2>
  <p>The family, the tribe, the community have all contributed to your beliefs. What is the source of confidence? What is the nature of insecurity? When you face the end of yourself, you can find answers to your questions. It can be an elaborate story, even science needs a story to be understood.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>We recognize our connection to a meaningful existence through storytelling.</h2>
  <p>For history to have definition beyond an outline, we have to process information over many years. How do we interpret the past? Is history an agreement? Is history an argument? What is the victor’s history?</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>For every possible belief there is someone to believe it.</h2>
  <p>People can believe anything and believe it is true. Belief can be willed. You can believe something to be true because you want it to be true, or because someone told you it was true. If people can believe anything they want and believe they are right, how can you tell when you’re deceiving yourself or when your perception of reality is being manipulated by others?</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>We ask questions to learn the truth.</h2>
  <p>Convincing arguments and presentations of select pieces of information can create a desired perception of reality. There is a difference between the desire to learn and the desire to be right. Actively questioning your beliefs leads to greater awareness.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>To arrive at a shared understanding, look at the problem together.</h2>
  <p>No one has perfect information. Simply ask questions about what can be perceived by everyone without needing people to acknowledge your beliefs. Rather than stating your beliefs, restate the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>To learn how to communicate with other people we relate to them.</h2>
  <p>Though we may not even understand our own feelings, we can find them expressed in music, books, and movies. Other people have had similar life experiences and through their stories we can better understand ourselves. Culture creates the context to relate more intimately with other people.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>To fulfill yourself, it helps to articulate your desires.</h2>
  <p>Being able to state your goals makes them more attainable, and people are often willing to help. If you say what you’d like to contribute and what you need, it’s more likely you can get it.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Self-expression is the key to personal growth.</h2>
  <p>By giving yourself permission to fully express yourself, you can learn from whatever happens. It’s okay to be imperfect because you’re always learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Dialogue is an art.</h2>
  <p>The structure of your speech matters as much as the content. You are responsible. By changing your tone of voice and body language, you could say the same thing and express something different. The desire to be understood improves the clarity of expression.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>The message depends upon its delivery.</h2>
  <p>Two people could say exactly the same thing but one could be believed and the other disbelieved depending on their social status. Who’s saying it, the method of delivery, and institutional supports all determine how we value what we hear from others. It is not the message that matters, but the people that give it value.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Correct speech and behavior exist as ideals.</h2>
  <p>We may do the right thing, or say the right thing, but these are ideals created by society. What would be accepted by one group could be inappropriate with a different group of people.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Ideal behavior is expressed by individuals.</h2>
  <p>We learn from examples set by others. Action is the model. By acting on the ideal, you can embody the ideal.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Your choice of heroes can be telling.</h2>
  <p>You may not be able to articulate your values, but the image of your hero symbolizes them and you grasp the symbol. The symbol can be held throughout the culture, or it can be personal. It can be a loved one. Your cultural heroes represent what you value.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Your role model represents values.</h2>
  <p>People have role models to adapt whatever advantageous behavior they display. We can imitate our peers or look to heroes. Ideally, the people in your daily life can provide guidance.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>We test ourselves by accepting others.</h2>
  <p>It’s disconcerting to accommodate people who negate your reality. If they actively challenge your beliefs, this can feel like a physical threat. We believe for a reason; we believe to survive.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Accepting other people is easier when you see beyond socially constructed identity.</h2>
  <p>We have ideas about reality, but it’s not possible to know everything. We use symbols, stories, and ideas to understand the world. It’s valuable to pay attention when the story becomes strange, uncomfortable, and new. Accepting reality is transformative.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>We communicate who we are before saying a word.</h2>
  <p>Your appearance communicates a social class. When people speak they use more than words.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>Love is vulnerable.</h2>
  <p>If I express my thoughts and feelings honestly, I make myself vulnerable. Being honest allows more genuine interaction with others. We define our relationships by how much truth they can tolerate.</p>
</div>
<div class="centered-text">
  <h2>We are social creatures.</h2>
  <p>You are born into a class, race, and culture. Being alone isn’t a favorable condition for survival. You need other people to survive. Your family. Your community. Your friends can help you realize your full potential. You see your higher self in another person and your love nurtures the emergence of the higher self.</p>
