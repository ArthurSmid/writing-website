      <h2><a href="../notebook/networked.html">Networked Humanity: How Do We Know What is Right or Wrong?</a></h2>
      <p class="pages">In <cite class="italic">The Anatomy of Inequality</cite>, author Per Molander describes one of the ways conservatives defend the status quo, a tactic called knowledge skepticism. By saying we can’t know a thing for certain, over the years conservatism has attempted to undermine egalitarian theories from advancing an alternative to the status quo. In human history, the status quo has been conditions of great inequality—an exception being the period after World War II to the 70s and on to present day in the Nordic countries. <span class="continue"><a href="notebook/networked.html"> Continue reading--></a></span></p>

      <h2><a href="#">Precedent for Digital Democracy: Comedy, the Best Party, and the Mayor of a Large City in Iceland</a></h2>
      <p class="pages">Reading Jón Gnarr, <cite class="italic">How I Became the Mayor of a Large City in Iceland and Changed the World</cite>, I found that a platform for citizens to inform each other and vote on issues had been implemented in Reykjavík beginning in October 2011. He has a chapter called “The World is Getting Better and Better” where he talks about the online platform Betri Reykjavík for citizens to find all the information about plans and projects for city districts and “read the ideas, opinions, and suggestions of others, discuss the proposed concept, present your own ideas, and then vote for or against.” <span class="continue"><a href="#"> Continue reading--></a></span></p>

      <h2><a href="#">The Nordic Countries and a Winnable Campaign for Women’s Rights in the US</a></h2>
      <p> <span class="continue"><a href="#">From the audience, listening to Sanders, it sounded like harangue. This is completely different, the opposite of the inspirational tone delivered by Obama, and it was different in another way. Sanders, in an early televised debate, lauded Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. This is the real difference between the candidates: Sanders didn’t present an amorphous hope, an idealized change, he pointed directly at social policy that works, that’s currently in place in other countries, social programs where the citizens have placed a significant portion of their income to public rather than private consumption. <span class="continue"><a href="#"> Continue reading--></a></span></p>

      <h2><a href="#">We Tell Stories that Reinforce Power: God, Royalty, and Professionals in Popular Culture</a></h2>
      <p class="pages">The stories in our culture reinforce the power structure of society. And western culture has become so globally dominant that it’s big enough to contain any story of rebellion against authority (emphasis on contain) without itself being threatened. Anyone want to buy an Occupy T-shirt? Even protest can be commercialized. <span class="continue"><a href="#"> Continue reading--></a></span></p>

      <h2><a href="#">Complementary Currency: Create a Diverse Monetary Ecosystem and a Resilient Economy</a></h2>
      <h3>Citizens Invested in Their Community</h3><br>
      <p>The dollar needs no introduction, but complementary currencies have different forms and uses. Though diverse, they all exist to facilitate exchange within a community. In times of high unemployment when spending money is scarce, a complementary currency can match the unmet needs with the unused resources of a local government. <span class="continue"><a href="#"> <span class="continue"><a href="#"> Continue reading--></a></span></p>

      <h2><a href="#">How about a Wiki for storytelling? Wiki-novel: Progressive Storytelling and Modern Book-making</a></h2>
      <p>A group of authors meet together as would musicians and tell each other stories. They decide to collaborate on a writing project and figure that something like a Google Doc would work. One of the writers is also a programmer and she has an idea to write some code for a wiki-novel: <span class="continue"><a href="#"> <span class="continue"><a href="#"> Continue reading--></a></span></p>
